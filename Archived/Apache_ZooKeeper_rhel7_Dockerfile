########## Linux on z Systems Dockerfile for Apache ZooKeeper version 3.5 #########
#
# This Dockerfile builds a basic installation of Apache ZooKeeper.

# All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications.
#
# To build this image, from the directory containing this Dockerfile
# (assuming that the file is named Dockerfile):
# docker build -t <image_name> .
#
# To Start Apache ZooKeeper Server use the following command.
