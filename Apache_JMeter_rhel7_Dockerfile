########## Linux on z Systems Dockerfile for Apache JMeter version 2.13 #########
#
# This Dockerfile builds a basic installation of Apache JMeter.
#
# The Apache JMeter application is open source software, a 100% pure JAVA application
# designed to load test functional behaviour and measure performance. It was originally
# designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions.
#
# To build this image, from the directory containing this Dockerfile
# (assuming that the file is named Dockerfile):
# docker build -t <image_name> .
#
# To create a container of Apache JMeter image run the below command:
# docker run --name <container_name> -it  <image_name>
#
# To test a JMX file use the following command:
# docker run --rm=true -v /path/to/JMX_file/filename.jmx:/filename.jmx jmeter_imagename /filename.jmx
